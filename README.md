# tree-stereo-dataset

Although trees are outstanding elements of outdoor scenery, they vary substantially in shape, color, texture, intensity, and density of their branches. Besides, natural conditions such as weather and lighting and surrounding and background objects can affect the appearance of a tree due to shadows, brightness, and occlusions. The Tree Stereo Dataset contains stereo image pairs and ground truth disparity maps. Also, it contains tree and ground image masks and segmented trees prepared by hand. The dataset was prepared with images from rural and semi-rural environments registered with a monocular RGB camera. For each scene, two shots shifted by a horizontal movement of the camera were taken, which provided a stereo image pair.
